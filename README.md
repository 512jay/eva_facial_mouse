# [EVA Facial Mouse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crea_si.eviacam.service)

EVA Facial Mouse allows the user to **control an Android&trade; device by tracking the face**.

Based on the movement of the face captured through the **front camera**, the app allows the user to control a pointer on the screen (i.e., like a mouse), which provides direct access to most elements of the user interface.

## Quick Start
[![Android App on Google Play](https://github.com/cmauri/eva_facial_mouse/blob/master/images/google-play-badge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crea_si.eviacam.service)

## For whom is EVA?

EVA is intended for those who cannot use a touchscreen. For instance, some people with amputations, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other disabilities may benefit from this app.

## Requirements

* Mobile phone or tablet
* Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or higher
* Front camera
* Dual-core processor or higher

See the [list of devices tested with EVA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxuIKbw92d9USPT_SvM0iCdWjtnVcx7owJAgwM6Za6w/).

## Limitations

Due to restrictions of the Android platform, there are currently some limitations.

* It cannot be used simultaneously with other applications that make use of the camera.
* Most standard keyboards do not work with EVA, so a basic keyboard is provided. Such a keyboard needs to be manually activated after the installation.
* Does not work with most games. 
* Browsers do not handle properly some actions (we recommend using Google Chrome).
* Applications such as Maps, Earth and Gallery work with restrictions.

For obvious reasons, EVA has not been tested with all devices available on the market. If you find any issues with your device, please, let us know.
